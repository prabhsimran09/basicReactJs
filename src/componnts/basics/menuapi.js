It was named by an Italian restaurateur, Alfredo Di Lelio, at his restaurant Alfredo on the Via della Scrofa in Rome in 1914. Di Lelio sold the restaurant in 1943, and opened another in 1950 at Piazza Augusto Imperatore, at first called \"L'Originale Alfredo \" and now \"Il Vero Alfredo \"; his nephews now manage it. Though pasta with butter and cheese is not uncommon, the name \"fettuccine Alfredo\" is largely unknown in Italy. In US cuisine it is sometimes mixed with other ingredients such as broccoli, parsley, cream, garlic, shrimp, or chicken, or all of the above."
